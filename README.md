# Api Learning Resource

This project is meant to teach basic API concepts through the use of an API in app.
It goes over concepts like Promises, Async Await, Synchronous vs Asynchronous, and 
Will also explain API methods(get,update,etc)

Stack: ReactJs,HTML/CSS, Javascript, Axios


Notes: I orginially started fetching API data with Javascript built in fetch() function, but i'm going to switch over to axios.
Axios is a lot cleaner and easier to work with. It makes working with promises a lot easier.
