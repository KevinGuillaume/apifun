# Api Output Cleaner

This project is meant to make api output look a bit easier to follow. Helps visualize the output!

Stack: ReactJs,HTML/CSS, Javascript, Axios and any api links you want!


Notes: I orginially started fetching API data with Javascript built in fetch() function, but i'm going to switch over to axios.
Axios is a lot cleaner and easier to work with.
